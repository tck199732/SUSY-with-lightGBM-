# SUSY-with-lightGBM-
SUSY data with machine learning (lightGBM,XGBoost)
The repository is created to fulfill the requirement of the course STAT 5850 "Applied Data Mining" at Western Michigan University.

The SUSY data set can be downloaded at https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets/SUSY.
This is a classification problem to distinguish between a signal process which produces supersymmetric particles and a background process which does not.

In this project, three separate jupyter notebooks are created just to avoid confusion.
1. STAT 5850 Applied Data Mining Final Project
        An introduction to the classification problem and a breif examination of test error using traditional parameteric methods           with Sklearn.
3. XGBoost
        Using XGBoost libary
5. LightGBM
        Using LightGBM libary
